- created abstract class virtual pet
- created subclasses of robot pet and organic pet
- then created two more within robot pet- robot cat, and robot dog
- same for organic pet- created a organic cat, and organic dog
- most of the functionality happened in the virtual pet shelter class, ended up with 21 tests
- I added more options for the user of oil pets, walk the dogs, clean litter boxes, and clean cages
- added 2 more options 2 see a list of all robot pets, and all organic pets
- overall I think I hit most of the objectives, looking back I think I might have utilized interfaces, and look for a more
Efficient way to utilize the tick method.  I have one and it is different than the way I used it in pet shelter project, but I don't think its much better.
